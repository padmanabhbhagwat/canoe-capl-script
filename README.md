# canoe-capl-script
Hi everyone I am including this file in my repository for anyone trying to test their CANoe/CANanlyzer configuration.
This repository is for anyone who wants to start with their CANoe analysis and their career in the automotive industry.
CAPL (Communication Access Programming Language) is an event driven language which is mostly based on 'C'.
Anybody with a beginner level experience in 'C' can perform CAPL Scripting.
To start with CANoe/CANanlyzer CAPL scripting no Vector license is required, it is free of cost.
If one wishes to add their Configuration file (.CDD) and add a Database (.DBC) to CANoe then a VECTOR LICENSE (eg:VN1630A) is required to execute the code.
To write the CAPL script one has to open the CAPL browser from CANoe->Tools->CAPL Browser.
After writing the script and saving it, one has to open the file in a network node inside the Simulation Setup. (CANoe->Simulation->Simulation Setup)
After opening the file, compile it in the network node and you're good to go.
